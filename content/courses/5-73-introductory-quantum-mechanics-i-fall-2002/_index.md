5.73 covers fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics: wave properties, uncertainty principles, Schrodinger equation, and operator and matrix methods. Basic applications of the following are discussed: one-dimensional potentials (harmonic oscillator), three-dimensional centrosymetric potentials (hydrogen atom), and angular momentum and spin. The course also examines approximation methods: WKB method, variational principle, and perturbation theory.

##### Acknowledgement

The instructor would like to acknowledge Peter Giunta for preparing the original version of the materials for 5.73.
